# Spotify-Songs-Genre-Segmentation
This project explores and segments a dataset of Spotify songs based on their audio features to identify underlying genre groupings. Using unsupervised machine learning techniques like clustering (e.g., K-Means), we group songs with similar characteristics such as loudness, tempo, energy, danceability, and more.
